# Create GLEIF Group Multisig AID

Once all members of a given GLEIF Group Multisig AID (either GLEIF External or GLEIF Internal) have created their local AIDs
as described in [Getting Started](getting-started.md) the group multisig AID can be created using the following steps.

1. Join a Video Call with all other GARs.
2. Send your OOBI over video call.
3. Receive OOBIs over video call.
4. Send challenge message to others.
5. Receive challenge messages.
6. Configure and join the multisig group.


All members must complete the first 5 steps as described below.  Once that has been completed, one member of the group must
be selected as the Lead.  The Lead is responsible for running the Group Multisig Shell to generate the configuration file
for the group multisig AID and initiate the inception with that configuration file.  All other members will join the multisig
group once they receive the notification from the Lead.  The rest of this document describes the entire process
